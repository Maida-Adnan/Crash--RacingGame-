# Crash--RacingGame-
This project pushed us to work deeply with low-level operations, graphics handling, memory management, and event-driven logic, and it truly strengthened my problem-solving skills.
B& Project Highlights:
• Designed and implemented a playable car game with smooth controls
• Used low-level concepts like interrupts, memory-mapped video output, and assembly integration
• Built complete menus, collision handling, scoring, and level mechanics
• Optimized logic for performance in a low-level environment
